	    <h1>Eltrac's Self Introduction</h1>
	    <p>Hi, guys! Nice to meet you. ü•∞</p>
		<p>I am Eltrac Koalar <code>/'eltr√¶k' k…î:l…ô/</code>, a Chinese Student who is interested in programing, especially front-end. I'm just a student but trying to study HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
		Also, I would like to learn Python or Golang. However, I think I'm better at web design instead of software engining.</p>
        <p>I often develop my project and explore others' on <a href="https://github.com/BigCoke233">GitHub</a>. I think I'm the kind of people who have a lot of creative ideas, though I can't achive all of them. 
		But the process of trying to make them true is great fun for me even if it's not easy.</p>
		<p>Besides programing, I've kept on blogging for about two years as a hobby. I once deleted the database of my old blog a year ago and the new one has been available for a year.
		Though the old record might be the good memories but I'm really more satisfied with the new one. And sometimes I recall the articles I wrote before, I would feel bad because those words seemed stupid. 
		Maybe this is what we call growth. So I think it quite meaningful to keep a blog. Speaking of which, here's <a href="https://guhub.cn">the link to my blog</a>. Welcome if you're glad, but it's in Chinese.</p>
		<p>Although I'm a Chinese, I prefer listening to Englishi pop songs. And Billie Eilish is my favorite singer because I love her voice and style! 
		I also like listening to the songs by Tones and I, Troye, Taylor Swift, Chloe Moriondo. I love these singers but I don't think they should be the standard of good music. 
		Good music is just what can make people feel good.</p>
		<p>Cartoon is a way for pleasure as well. I watch cartoon animation in my spare time and my favorite anmie series are <em>Rick and Morty</em> and <em>We bare bears</em>. 
		Some japanese cartoon is also attractive to me but I don't actually watch them often.</p>
		<p>I play Minecraft usually. I really really really love this video game and it's more fun to play with friends. I just love this feeling when I survive and create something with my close friends.
		I got <em>Don't Starve Together</em> on my steam. It's a great game that has a large background story. The characters also attract me.
		And I'm gonna talk about my favorite RPG Game, <em>Undertale</em>!!!. It's an excellent work by Toby Fox. I love this and hope you guys who read this to go play it if you don't know about this awesome game. 
		Hmmm, I think I don't play video game much except those I just mentioned.</p>
		<p>About my life, I can tell only a little. First, I am gay and I think there's nothing wrong though I experienced something painful in love. I am also a depressed person.
		But I'm alright, just still alive, living normally.</p>
		<p>Just stay determined and Life will go on.</p>
